# Poker-Game-Extension
A card game that combines strategy, skill, and luck. All players are dealt 2 cards face down, followed by 5 cards face up. Players must make the best possible 5 card poker hand using the 5 community cards and their own face down hole cards. The best 5 card poker hand wins the hand and receives the pot.

## Explanation

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure with sections for each player's hand, community cards, and a button to deal the cards.

2. **CSS**: Styles the game, centering elements and giving the cards a simple visual representation.

3. **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, including:
   
-   Creating and shuffling the deck.
Dealing two cards to each player and five community cards.
Rendering the dealt cards to the screen.
Using setTimeout to simulate the stages of dealing the community cards (flop, turn, river).
