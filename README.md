# Poker-Game-Extension
A card game that combines strategy, skill, and luck. All players are dealt 2 cards face down, followed by 5 cards face up. Players must make the best possible 5 card poker hand using the 5 community cards and their own face down hole cards. The best 5 card poker hand wins the hand and receives the pot.

## Explanation

1. **HTML**: Defines the structure with sections for each player's hand, community cards, and a button to deal the cards.

2. **CSS**: Styles the game, centering elements and giving the cards a simple visual representation.

3. **JavaScript**: Handles the game logic, including:
   
-   Creating and shuffling the deck.
 
-   Dealing two cards to each player and five community cards.
    
-   Rendering the dealt cards to the screen.
  
-   Using setTimeout to simulate the stages of dealing the community cards (flop, turn, river).
